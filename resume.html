        <h3> Skills: </h3>
        <p> I am a hardworking, patient, and tolerable person who can worked with others. Others can easily get along with me and I 
             can easily get along with them. Although I can enjoy my work environment and see the positive side of things, I can also acknowledge the negative side of things and get serious about my tasks and work hard for any improvements within the job or myself.
             I can speak proficiently in Spanish and English, and I can also write and read the two languages. During my time in school, 
             I assisted a web page design course and a multimedia course as well and gained a basic concept and understanding of how coding,
             editing software, and computers works. I had an interest in these subjects
             and was willing to learn more. As a quick learner, I can adapt to my work surroundings.</p>
